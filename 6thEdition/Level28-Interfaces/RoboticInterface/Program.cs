// Answer this question: Do you feel this is an improvement over using an abstract base class? Why or why not?
//
// In this situation, I think this is better. For starters, there's less code to do the same thing. No need
// to have those abstracts and overrides everywhere. But at a more substantial level, inheritance is a pretty
// strong relationship, and these commands do not really need to have that strong of a relationship to each
// other. The only thing that really binds them together is that they do the same type of thing. So I think
// it is better for that reason.
